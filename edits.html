        <p>I also have experience editing interview-style and documentary-style footage. If it needs cutting, I got the scissors.</p>
        <h3><strong>MY VIDEO ESSAYS (CURRENTLY IN-PROGRESS)</strong></h3>
        <p><strong>HOUSE OF ANUBIS: A RETROSPECTIVE -</strong> If you've seen (or at least heard of) those 3+ hour video essays on a show or video game you will never personally experience for yourself but end up consuming via said essay anyway, that's what this is. Lots of critical media analysis done in the name of camp.</p>
        <p><strong>POKEFARM: DEATH OF THE FORUM -</strong> Really obscure Pokemon fanforum I grew up using with a lot of documented drama. I collated all of it and ended up making some interesting observations about the nature of content moderation/site administration that, despite coming from another era of the Internet, are still relevant to this day.</p>
        <p><strong>THE LOST ART OF FILLER -</strong> My hill to die on, my ultimate diatribe, my magnum opus. I defend the concept of the "filler episode" as a necessary part of a television show's anatomy.</p>

            <p><strong>CLASS: BARD</strong> (glorified jester who will definitely entertain you but can't pick a medium and stick to it)</p>
            <p><strong>ORIGIN: RAISED BY THE INTERNET</strong> (and also my parents I guess)</p>
            <p><strong>STRENGTH: 8/20</strong> Never asked to stack the chairs. Not to be trusted with jars. Accidentally punched my friend once and came out more injured than he did.</p>
            <p><strong>DEXTERITY: 12/20</strong> Good reflexes, but clumsy. Case in point: threw cooked spaghetti everywhere but caught it full-fist before it hit the ground.</p>
            <p><strong>CONSTITUTION: Undefined.</strong> I have an "accidentally ate two week old leftovers and was fine"-type iron stomach, but sometimes breathing gives me a tummy ache.</p>
            <p><strong>CHARISMA: Undefined.</strong> I’m a writer. You’re the audience. This score is up to you, dog.</p>
            <p><strong>INTELLIGENCE: 15/20</strong> Filled with facts that you'd consider useless until you find yourself about to mix two chemicals that should NEVER be mixed. I contain about eight AP exams and a few hundred Wikipedia articles.</p>
            <p><strong>WISDOM: 15/20</strong> You figure out a lot of stuff when you talk to yourself about it for a few hours. Ability bonus doubles when applied to other people's problems.</p>
            <p><strong>Resistance to poison</strong> (see: leftovers incident).</p>
            <p><strong>WEAPON:</strong> “my sick axe dude” (keytar)</p>
            <p><strong>ARMOR:</strong> “The Cringe Jacket” (one (1) entire tax return; absorbs and reflects psychic damage), “The Italian Jeans” ($90 retail, $20 thrifted; useless zippers distract opponents), Docs (immune to piercing damage)</p>
            <p><strong>INVENTORY:</strong> Planner (I die instantly without it), Spock Prayer Candle, work gloves/swiss army knife/electrical tape/tape measure, and four (4) comically large keychains.</p>
